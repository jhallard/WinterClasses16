LSTMs in C++
========

This is 1/3rd of my final project for CS112 Comparative Programming Languages at UCSC, Winter Quarter 2016. Here I implement an API for creating and using LSTMs in Python. I have made two other implementations, one in C++ and the other in Haskell, which can also be found in this repository.
